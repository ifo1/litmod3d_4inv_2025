.SH DESCRIPTION
.B LitMod3D_4inv
is a tool for combined geophysical-petrological 3D forward/inversion modelling within a probabilistic MCMC framework. It is developed to study the thermal, compositional, density and seismological structure of lithosphere and sublithosphere domains by combining data from petrology and mineral physics with geophysical observables in a self-consistent framework.

.SH OPTIONS: GENERAL INPUT-OUTPUT

.TP
.B \-i \fR[\fIDIRECTORY\fR]
A relative or an absolute path to an input directory with the model to be computed.
.br
\fBExample:\fR $ ./LITMOD.i -i input_inversion
.br
\fBDefault:\fR the current working directory.
.br
\fBSee also:\fR -ss, -o

.TP
.B \-dc \fR[\fIFILE\fR]
A path (with name) to a file with a seismic velocity model (e.g. 1D profile PREM or ak135f or a 3D model like GyPSuM) for the depths below the 410 km. This file is used solely for dispersion curves computation. The path is always relative to the current input directory.
.br
\fBExample:\fR $ ./LITMOD.i -i input_inversion -dc startmod.dat
.br
\fBDefault:\fR in 1D mode LitMod tries to read dispcurve_ak135.dat and in 3D mode LitMod tries to read dispcurve_gypsum.dat
.br
\fBSee also:\fR -i, -dcind

.TP
.B \-rt \fR[\fIDIRECTORY\fR]
A relative or an absolute path to a directory with the Ray Tracer input files. If set to a relative path, the current working directory is used as the starting point.
.br
\fBExample:\fR $ ./LITMOD.i -i input_synthetic4 -rt input_rt
.br
\fBDefault:\fR current input directory.
.br
\fBSee also:\fR -i

.TP
.B \-o \fR[\fIDIRECTORY\fR]
A relative or an absolute path to a directory for outputs.
.br

.br
\fBDefault:\fR a directory called perplex in the current working directory.

.TP
.B \-v \fR[\fIDIRECTORY\fR]
Screen outputs during MCMC inversion. By default, LITMOD3D prints statistics with the number of rejected proposals and acceptance ratio after every accepted model. To turn this redudant and excessive messaging, use:
.br
\fBExample:\fR $ ./LITMOD.i -i input_inversion -v 0

.TP

.br
\fBDefault:\fR none.
.br
\fBSee also:\fR -o, -wper, -os
.br
\fBAvailable options:\fR
.RS
.IP \fB0\fP
\- Native XYZ files (suitable for GMT package, like psxy) in the format same to the one used for the input models (so they can be used to restart an inversion from an arbitrary step).
.br
Use ./plot_gmt6.sh script to plot the input model with GMT v6.
.IP \fB1\fP
\- Write the seismic velocity model, events and receivers in the FMTOMO format. XYZ can be converted to VTK using the script:
.br
$ ./xyz_to_vtk.sh input.xyz output.vtk
.br
If the individual records of data (e.g. individual ray paths) are separated by line with ">" character, one can specify the min and max records:
.br
$ ./xyz_to_vtk.sh input.xyz output.vtk 15 20
.br
In order to compare the FMTOMO and LitMod3D_4inv (or observed) travel times, use:
.br
$ echo "LitMod3D_4inv FMTOMO" > res.txt
.br
$ paste <( tail -n+2 otimes.dat | head -n `cat arrivals.dat | wc -l` ) arrivals.dat |awk '{print $5,$11}' | grep -v -F -- '-1.00' | sort -u -k 1,1 -n >> res.txt
.IP \fB2\fP
\- HDF5 output. Requires Serial HDF5 installed and linked with LitMod3D_4inv. This format allows to print the model in 3D after convertation to .stl; perhaps via .vrml/.wrl. Use \fBh5dump \-w 0 ./*.h5\fR to view the files in ASCII. See also: \fB\-3dscale\fR
.IP \fB3\fP
\- Relaxed JSON format to output the full proposal data (only for debug purposes). Use the following command to convert it to strict JSON:
$ cat FILE | sed 's/\\-\\./-0./g' | sed 's/\\,\\./,0./g' | sed 's/\\[\\./[0./g' | sed 's/\\,\\\]/]/g' > FILE2
.IP \fB4\fP
\- Ray Tracer native output. This option is selected automatically if LitMod3D_4inv starts in the RT escape mode (with \fB\-rtescape\fR 1 option) OR LitMod3D creates a synthetic model and native LitMod input files are written.
.IP \fB5\fP
\- TileDB output. See also: \fB\-t\fR 13, \fB\-readtiledb\fR, \fB\-tdbchunk\fR, \fB\-readtiledbcolumn\fR, \fB\-tiledbprimtosec\fR.
.IP \fB6\fP
\- PNG images. See also: \fBpng_add_title.sh\fR script.
.IP \fB7\fP
\- HDF5 model with 2 km resolution. Requires a special compilation mode set in the makefile.
.RE

.TP
.B \-wper \fR[\fINUMBER\fR]
Periodicity of writing for ASCII, HDF5 and PNG outputs.
.br
\fBExample:\fR to write out every 100th accepted proposal, use:
.br
$ ./LITMOD.i -i input_inversion -o output -w 2 -w 5 -wper 100
.br
\fBDefault:\fR write out every accepted proposal (extremely ineffective!).
.br
\fBNotice:\fR TileDB always writes out every accepted proposal.
.br
\fBNotice:\fR Generally, the period of writing out should be of the same order of magnitude as the number of columns in the model.
.br
\fBSee also:\fR -w


.TP
.B \-nodup \fR[\fINUMBER\fR]
Set whether duplicates in the input files are allowed. If no duplicates are allowed [Default] the code will stop if the input files contain more than one entry for a column. Otherwise, the code will use the latest set of values for every column. This option allows to merge models from different sources.

.TP
.B \-tdbchunk \fR[\fINUMBER\fR]
Number of columns to be cashed before TileDB dumps data to the hard drive. Bigger number results in less IO, but requires more RAM.
.br
\fBExample:\fR $ ./LITMOD.i -i input_inversion -o output -w 5 -tdbchunk 10000
.br
\fBDefault:\fR write out in packs of 1000 columns.
.br
\fBNotice:\fR This is the size (in columns) of the internal LitMod cash used to store the data before it is sent to TileDB output routines. Generally, rare outputs improve the performace.
.br
\fBSee also:\fR -w

.TP
.B \-readtiledb \fR[\fIDIRECTORY\fR] \fR[\fIFIELD\fR] \fR[\fINXMIN\fR] \fR[\fINXMAX\fR] \fR[\fINYMIN\fR] \fR[\fINYMAX\fR] \fR[\fINSTEPMIN\fR] \fR[\fINSTEPMAX\fR]
Read the TileDB dataset and output the specific field from it.
.br
\fBExample:\fR First, create a sample LitMod3D TileDB output:
.br
$ ./LITMOD.i -t 13
.br
and then use:
.br
$ ./LITMOD.i -readtiledb litmod_tiledb_testdata Rayleigh -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
.br
to read the whole dataset. One can also specify the cell range (longitude, latitude, interval of MCMC steps)
.br
\fBSee also:\fR -w

.TP
.B \-readtiledbcolumn \fR[\fIDIRECTORY\fR] \fR[\fIIX\fR] \fR[\fIIY\fR] \fR[\fINMntlLay\fR] \fR[\fINClay\fR] \fR[\fISTEPMIN\fR] \fR[\fISTEPMAXfR]
Read a TileDB dataset and output the data for a column with NClay crustal layers (i.e. N-1 of conductive lithospheric layers set in the model header.dat file) with coordinates (IX,IY) and in the given step interval. Returns depths in kilometres.
.br
\fBExample:\fR First, create a LitMod3D TileDB output:
.br
$ ./LITMOD.i -i input_inversion -o output -w 5
.br
and then use:
.br
$ ./LITMOD.i -readtiledbcolumn output/tdb1 Layers 1 10 2 3 -1 -1
.br
\fBSee also:\fR -w, -o

.TP
.B \-tiledbprimtosec \fR[\fIDIRECTORY\fR]
Convert a TileDB output with the primary parameters (layer thicknesses, crustal Vp/Vs, chemical compositions of the mantle and so on) to an extended database with secondary parameters (geotherms, mantle mineral phase fractions and compositions and some others, as well as all the primary parameters). A
.br
\fBExample:\fR First, create a LitMod TileDB output:
.br
$ ./LITMOD.i -i input_inversion -o output -w 5 -mcmcsteps 10000
.br
Then run this command:
.br
$ ./LITMOD.i -i input_inversion -o ./output/sec -tiledbprimtosec output/tdb1 -mcmcsteps 10000
.br
\fBNotice:\fR this command relies on the input provided by other commands: \fB\-i\fR specifies a path to the model header file, \fB\-o\fR is a path to the resulting (secondary) database, \fB\-tiledbprimtosec\fR takes a path to the input (primary) database, \fB\-mcmcsteps\fR (optional) should provide the same number that was used to perform an inversion (i.e. it might be different from the value coming in the header.dat file), \fB\-ss\fR and \fB\-os\fR flags (optional) in this command change their behaviour and supply the start and the end step to be read from the primary TileDB database (i.e. they can remove the burnin steps or cut the tail).
.br
\fBNotice:\fR It is safe to run LitMod in this mode in parallel via MPI.

.TP
.B \-rfonly \fR[\fINUMBER\fR]
During postprocessing (secondary TileDB coputation): use \fB\-rfonly\fR 1 to compute only the receiver functions with the TileDB postprocessing. During normal MCMC inversion: use \fB\-rfonly\fR 1 to invert only for the columns with RF data with potential fields and body waves switched off. By \fB[default]\fR, the whole domain will be processed.

The initial MCMC step of the inversion (for restarts).


.TP
.B \-hdf5sph \fR[\fINUMBER\fR]

.TP
.B \-hdf5smooth \fR[\fINUMBER\fR]
The smoothing window (3,5,7...) to use for HDF5 outputs. Use 1 \fB[default]\fR for no smoothing.

.TP
.B \-3dscale \fR[\fIR\fR] \fR[\fIZ\fR] \fR[\fIE\fR]
Scaling factors for HDF5 output (see also \fB\-w\fR 2 option). All these three values must be set. Default is to provide the model with natural coordinates except the elevation which is too small compared to other variables. Example of the command to make the output suitable for 3D printing: \fB\-3dscale\fR 20000 10 100 .
.RS
.IP \fBR\fP
\- Divider for the Earth radius which is used to compute all the spherical coordinates. Default value is 1.
.IP \fBZ\fP

.SH OPTIONS: INPUT-OUTPUT: REFERRING TO SPECIFIC FILES

.TP
While by default the code tries to read files by their default names with no suffixes attached, one may need to update the files and keep track of the changes. Notice, that every suffix is appended after an underscore.

.SH OPTIONS: MISFIT AND FORCIBLE COMPUTATION OF FIELDS

.TP
.B \-misfit \fR[\fINUMBER\fR]
Scale the value of initial misfit to the given value and apply the same scaling factor to all further misfits. The value controls PT swapping efficiency and probability of acceptance for a proposal.
.br
\fBExample:\fR to scale the initial misfit to 10000 use
.br
$ ./LITMOD.i -i input_inversion -misfit 10000
.br
\fBDefault:\fR use natural scaling (i.e. scaling with observables sigmas only). Equivalent to -misfit -1
.br
\fBSee also:\fR -misfitwt1, -misfitwt2

.TP
.B \-misfitwt \fR[\fINUMBERS\fR]
Set multipliers for the individual misfit components to adjust their weight in the total misfit. Use zeros to disable a certain misfit component. Values for every component must be provided, even if the specific component is not used in the current computation. The normal value is one. The components with weight below 0.01 are disabled.
.br
\fBExample:\fR to make the elevation misfit component 10 times greater use
.br
$ ./LITMOD.i -i input_inversion -misfitwt 1 10 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
.br
\fBNotice:\fR none of the misfit weights can be negative.
.br
\fBNotice:\fR the effect of this key is totally equivalent to scaling of observable sigmas (notice that the value of sigma will be squared during misfit computation)
.br
\fBDefault:\fR use natural scaling (i.e. scaling with observables sigmas only). Equivalent to -misfitwt 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
.br

.RE

.TP
.B \-misfitwt1 \fR[\fISTEPX\fR] \fR[\fINUMBERS\fR]
.TQ
.B \-misfitwt2 \fR[\fISTEPY\fR] \fR[\fINUMBERS\fR]
Divide the entire simulation into three stages:
.br
1) before the MCMC step number X: the first set of misfit scaling factors (weights) applies
.br
2) in between the step X and step Y: a linearly interpolated set of values is used
.br
3) after the MCMC step Y (Y > X): the second set of misfit scaling factors applies, and in between the step X and step Y
.br
\fBExample:\fR $ ./LITMOD.i -i input_inversion -mcmcsteps 100000 -misfitwt1 5000 0 10 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 -misfitwt2 20000 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 100
.br
to make the elevation component more permissive in the beginning of the inversion.
.br
\fBNotice:\fR all misfit weights must be above zero.
.br
\fBDefault:\fR use natural scaling during the entire simulation (i.e. scaling with observables sigmas only and the scaling factors equal 1).
.br
\fBSee also:\fR -misfitwt to check the order of the individual misfit components


.TP
.B \-misfitcomp \fR[\fINUMBER(S)\fR]
Select misfit components to use. Not-used fields won't be computed and the corresponding misfits will equal to zero. Mutually exclusive with misfitwt.
.br
\fBExample:\fR $ ./LITMOD.i -i input_inversion -misfitcomp 3 2
.br
to use elevation and Rayleigh phase velocities
.br
\fBDefault:\fR equivalent to -misfitcomp 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 (depends on the header.dat seismic settings)
.br
\fBNotice\fR: it is strongly recommended to use Bouguer and Free Air as mutually exclusive misfit components, because the differences in the Bouguer correction computation procedure may lead to inconsistency between the LitMod3D_4inv solver and any other data source.

.TP
.B \-normobs \fR[\fIBOOLEAN\fR]

.br
\fBExample:\fR $ ./LITMOD.i -i input_inversion -normobs 1
.br
\fBDefault:\fR do not normalise (equivalent to -normobs 0)
.br
\fBSee also:\fR -misfitwt

.TP
.B \-misfitequal \fR[\fINUMBER\fR]
Different individual misfit components may have very different absolute values, which effectively supresses low-value components. This option allows to rescale the individual components to the similar absolute values at the beginning of an MCMC inversion. Use this option to set the maximum allowed ratio of the greatest misfit component to the smallest one at the beginning of the simulation.
.br
\fBExample:\fR $ ./LITMOD.i -i input_inversion -misfitequal 3
.br
\fBDefault:\fR do not rescale (equivalent to -misfitequal -1)

.br
to rescale the misfit to 10000 after every 20000 steps

to rescale the misfit to 10000 every time it becomes 10 times smaller than the original value
.br
$ ./LITMOD.i -i input_inversion -misfit 10000 -misfitrscltimes 10 -mcmcsteps 100000 -misfitrscltimes 3
.br
to rescale the misfit to 10000 when it becomes 10 times smaller than the original value, and limit the number of rescalings to three

A threshold value of the PT temperature to switch between single proposal (MH) and multiproposal (MTM, MTMIS) chains. If the value passed to this variable is non-negative, MCMCs with PT temperature higher than this value are computed with Metropolis-Hastings, while chains with lower PT temperatures use Multiple-Try Metropolis or Multiple-Trial Metropolized Independence Sampler (look \-mtmis switch). If the value passed to this variable is negative, MCMCs with PT temperature lower than the absolute value are computed with Metropolis-Hastings, while chains with higher PT temperatures use Multiple-Try Metropolis or Multiple-Trial Metropolized Independence Sampler.

.RS
.IP \fBQuantity\fP
\- Each sampling MCMC must run on individual CPU. Use \fB\-ptt1chains\fR option to set the number of PTT=1 chains
.IP \fBVertical\fP
\- during vertical phases each PTT=1 chain (CPU) sample the domain with a set of proposals. Generally, code is optimized for high number of vertical steps compared to the number of columns in the model (i.e. all or nearly all columns change during this phase). During this phase MCMCs may utilize Metropolis-Hastings or MTM/MTMIS techniques and perform PT swaps.
.IP \fBHorizontal\fP
\- during horizontal phases (i.e. all the subchains logically merge to one MCMC) LitMod3D applies Sample Metropolis-Hastings (SMH) technique. All the chains compute a global mean model and its variation, which is used to create a whole-domain proposal. Then all the PTT=1 CPUs compute this whole-domain proposal and only the selected PTT=1 MCMC decided whether to accept it or reject.
.IP \fBPerformance\fP
\- to gain the maximum performance, it is highly recommended that number of columns in model is dividable by number of PTT=1 CPUs and each of PTT>1 CPUs compute a number of proposals (MTM/MTMIS) equal to number of columns per each CPU during Horizontal phase.

Sets the minimum number of points in the frequency domain to compute the receiver functions. The default way is to set it as the first power of two to exceed the number of observed RF points. This estimate is prone to result in a "flat" end of the computed receiver functions and therefore miss important signal information. Therefore, one may need to set it manually as the power of two (256, 512, 1024 ...) to allow the code for high frequencies and long recorded RFs.

Currently the code allows to generate synthetic rays in parallel (with MPI). In that case the user must execute

During run in this test mode, first, the depth of a given layer is assigned to a provided value. Then LitMod3D computes the forward problem for the entire model and enters into MCMC simulations part. Instead of random selection of columns, it consequently picks all the columns one after another and changes the prescribed layer boundary depth with a given step.

.TP
.B ./create_covmat.sh \fR[\fIfolder with model\fR] \fR[\fInumber of MCMC steps\fR]
This script runs LitMod3D for each column individually, looping through all the columns consequentally. After each run it extracts the data from TileDB files (i.e. LitMod3D must be compiled with TileDB) to compute the covariance matrix for the particular column and append it to a data file in the input directory.

.TP
.B ./testsuite.sh \fR[\fIOPTION(S)\fR]
Testsuite is a script to perform an extensive testing of the LitMod3D_4inv binary. The user may previously need to modify the script header to provide the exact addresses to system fortran and C complires, as well as MPICH/OpenMPI installation and valgrind. By default the script attempts to build the LitMod3D_4inv binary with all the possible options. Additional tests can be invoked with:
.RS
.IP \fBt\fP
\- Run tests for individual parts of the LitMod3D_4inv.
.IP \fBr\fP
\- Run actual LitMod3D_4inv synthetic and inversion computations, as well as a few tests for their results.
.IP \fBv\fP
\- Use valgrind toolkit to analyze the LitMod3D_4inv runs extensively (activates r option)
.IP \fBs\fP
\- Perform the default sets of tests for the last built exeutable (without rebuilding it).

.B Consolidating and vacuuming TileDB output
The TileDB output produced by LitMod3D_4inv inversions might contain tons of folders and its sharing might be extremely inefficient. Use the following python script to consolidate the data:
.br
import tiledb
.br
tiledb.consolidate(path_to_tiledb)
.br
tiledb.vacuum(path_to_tiledb)

If it is rejected by the Metropolis rule (typically when there is a large misfit between the synthetic data and the observed data for this first data subset), then there is no need to solve the forward prob- lem for the other data subsets, and the rules sampling the prior have to propose a new mode"

This is because the eigenvalues of the matrix K can decay very rapidly [...] and without this stabilization the Cholesky decomposition fails. The effect on the generated samples is to add additional independent noise of variance $\epsilon$."

.SH APPENDIX 2 - PROPOSAL GENERATION MODES

.TP
Following codes describe the way to generate proposals for each specific parameter (variable, unknown). Should be specified in propbounds files.

.RS
.IP \fB0\fP
do not sample
.IP \fB1\fP
sample the chemical compounds (FeO, MgO, and CaO) using a uniform distribution and min and max bounds as a function of given Al2O3 content (which should be set using other proposal modes
.IP \fB2\fP
sample the chemical compounds (FeO, MgO, and CaO) using a normal distribution centred at the current compound content and min and max bounds as a function of given Al2O3 content (which should be set using other proposal modes
.IP \fB11\fP
sample the parameter from a uniform distribution between min and max bounds specified in the input files (independently from the other components)
.IP \fB12\fP
sample the parameter from a uniform distribution between min and max bounds specified in the input files (independently from the other components) before the first adaptation, and then sample with the covariance matrix
.IP \fB20\fP
sample the parameter from a normal distribution centred at the current value independently from the other components
.IP \fB21\fP
sample the parameter from a normal distribution centred at the current value (independently from the other components) with min and max bounds specified in the input files. If the drawn value is out of the min and max bounds, the whole proposal is rejected (misfit is set to infinity).
.IP \fB22\fP
sample the parameter from a normal distribution centred at the current value (independently from the other components). The value is resampled until a number within the min and max bounds specified in the input files is obtained.
.IP \fB23\fP
sample the parameter from a normal distribution centred at the current value (independently from the other components). If the drawn value is out of min and max bounds specified in the input files, only this value will be forcibly set to the corresponding bound.
.IP \fB30\fP
sample the parameter using a covariance matrix (so it can be correlated with the other parameters, while not correlated with the others)
.IP \fB31\fP
sample the parameter using a covariance matrix (so it can be correlated with the other parameters, while not correlated with the others). If the drawn value is out of the min and max bounds specified in the input files, the whole proposal is rejected (misfit is set to infinity).
.IP \fB32\fP
sample the parameter using a covariance matrix (so it can be correlated with the other parameters, while not correlated with the others). If the drawn value is out of min and max bounds specified in the input files, only this value will be resampled using the square root of the corresponding diagonal element of the covariance matrix as a standard deviation for a corresponding normal distribution centred at the current value.
.IP \fB33\fP
sample the parameter using a covariance matrix (so it can be correlated with the other parameters, while not correlated with the others). If the drawn value is out of min and max bounds specified in the input files, only this value will be forcibly set to the corresponding bound.
.RE

.TP
Multiproposal techniques impose certain criteria on the proposal distribution:
.RS
.IP \fBMTM\fP
\- must be used with normal proposal distributions centred at the current state of the chain. Do not use it with a uniform distribution of any component.
.IP \fBMTMIS\fP
\- must be used with uniform proposal distributions.
.RE

.SH APPENDIX 3 - COLUMN INDEXING

.TP
The two ways to index columns are used in different situation:
.RS
.IP \fB(Ix,Iy)\fP
\- Ix sets the longitudal index starting from 1 at the southern edge of the model and going up to the northern edge at Nx. Iy sets the latitudal index starting from 1 at the western edge of the model and going up to the western edge at Ny. The column data supplied in the input files is assigned to the nearmost columns.
.IP \fB(Icol)\fP
\- Column index is defined as Icol = (Iy-1)*Nx + Ix , where x stands for longitude and y stands for latitude.
